# PostgresDB Go Library

This library provides an interface to interact with a Postgres database. It allows you to store, retrieve, delete data, and perform batch insertions and deletions.

## Installation

To use this library, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Usage

First, you need to initiate the interface with the `NewPostgresDB(name, dir string)` function. This function returns a new instance of `PostgresDB`.

Here is an example of how to use it:

```go
// Create a new instance of PostgresDB
db, err := NewPostgresDB("indexer:indexer123@localhost:5433", "indexer")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Failed to create a new instance of PostgresDB: %v", err)
}
```

After creating a new instance, you can use it to interact with your database. Here is an example of how to set and get data:

```go
// Set up test data
key := []byte("test_key")
value := []byte("test_value")

// Call the Set method
err = db.Set(key, value)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Failed to set data: %v", err)
}

// Verify that the value is set correctly
result, err := db.Get(key)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Failed to get data: %v", err)
}
```

For more examples and use cases, please refer to the test examples in the repository.
